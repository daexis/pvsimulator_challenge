# Version 1.1 Changes
1. Changed "Broker startup delay" procedure
Now app didn't waiting to 20 seconds when the broker starts. App checking broker's open port and when port starts to listening, app starts simulation.
Checking thru netcat utility from entrypoint bash script.

2. Changed from "Realtime simulation" to once per minute simulation.
Now app didn't waiting (sleeping) for next simulation iteration and generating new data without delay.
ITERATION (sec.) value is spacing between two data simulations.
QTY of simulations per day is 24*60*60/ITERATION.

3. Changed output csv procedure.
Now we are saving data to output file who contains daily values,
so app generating several output files in format filename_dayXXX.csv.

4. Added execution time of each day simulating.
Meashure execution time from starting meter simulator up to saving final value from broker to output file.
