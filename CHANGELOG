# Version 1.1 Changes
1. Changed "Broker startup delay" procedure
Now app didn't waiting to 20 seconds when the broker starts. App checking broker's open port and when port starts to listening, app starts simulation.
Checking thru netcat utility from entrypoint bash script.

2. Changed from "realtime simulation" to once per minute simulation.
Now app didn't waiting (sleeping) for next simulation iteration and generating new data without delay.
TIME_ITER (sec.) value is spacing between two data simulations.
QTY of simulations per day is 24*60*60/TIME_ITER.

3. Changed output csv procedure.
Now to output file saves data who contains daily values,
so app generating several output files in format filename_dayXXX.csv.

4. Added execution time of each day simulating.
Meashures execution time from starting meter simulator up to saving final value to output file.
Execution time is saved to file named "execution_time.log".

5. Changed algorithm of generating meter's value and pv simulator's value.

6. Added ploting of data from output file.
